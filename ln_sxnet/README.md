# LocoNetProjects - LN to Selectrix Bridge

To use LN-hardware on our Selectrix based club layout a "bridge" was built which currently receives the LocoNet "sensor" messages and translated them to "sxnet" TCP messages which are interpreted by the "SX3-PC" program and allow to map LN-sensor-states to SX-sensor-states.

Hardware:
Arduino-Ethernet + Fremo LN-Shield

Software:
Arduino SW, based on LocoNet library.


BETA !


Model Railroad Arduino Projects based on LocoNet and MRRWA code (see https://github.com/mrrwa )

Hardware is "OpenHardware" and in some cases is ported from https://opensx.net projects.
