# LocoNetProjects - LN-Base-1.0

Based on the design of the opensx-project "Basisplatine" (see https://opensx.net/projekte/basisplatine/rj45/ ), a new board was designed with an LN interface but the same pin layout for add-on boards - to be able to re-use some of the opensx designs



BETA-currently.
